Benchmark data structures in Go language

TODO:
* Use 8-character strings as data
* Use workload of fixed size for every cardinality
* Experiment with different kinds of workloads: balanced vs write-intensive vs read-intensive
* Size of data should not change by magnitude during benchmarking
* Test iterator to see how it performs
* Rename variables using camel notation
